# contactSheet
A collection of scripts to generate an HTML contact sheet for a collection of images in folders and subfolders. Images are presented in lines of three images.

Creates thumbnails with ImageMagick, uses the Python script to generate Markdown and then Pandoc to generate the HTML contact sheet.

Labels of the images are extracted from the names of the images using a regular expression and are selectable and copy-pastable.

Printing the HTML contact sheet is sort of OK.
